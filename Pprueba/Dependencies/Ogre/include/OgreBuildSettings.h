/** Support for multithreading, there are 3 options

OGRE_THREAD_SUPPORT = 0
    No support for threading.       
OGRE_THREAD_SUPPORT = 1
    Thread support for background loading, by both loading and constructing resources
    in a background thread. Resource management and SharedPtr handling becomes
    thread-safe, and resources may be completely loaded in the background. 
    The places where threading is available are clearly
    marked, you should assume state is NOT thread safe unless otherwise
    stated in relation to this flag.
OGRE_THREAD_SUPPORT = 2
    Thread support for background resource preparation. This means that resource
    data can streamed into memory in the background, but the final resource
    construction (including RenderSystem dependencies) is still done in the primary
    thread. Has a lower synchronisation primitive overhead than full threading
    while still allowing the major blocking aspects of resource management (I/O)
    to be done in the background.
OGRE_THREAD_SUPPORT = 3
    No synchronisation primitive overhead. WorkQueue is threaded.
